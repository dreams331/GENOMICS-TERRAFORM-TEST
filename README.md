# GENOMICS-TERRAFORM-TEST

WITH MY TERRAFORM CODE, I AM CREATING AND S3 BUCKET WITH A NOTIFICATION ATTACHED
NOTIFICATION THEN TRIGGER A LAMBDA FUNCTION.
THE LAMBDA.PY FILE CONTAINS THE LAMBDA LOGIC THAT WILL EXTRACT THE EXIF FROM THE IMAGE METADATA 
THEN MOVE IMAGE TO AN OUTPUT DESTINATION S3 BUCKET IF THE EXTRACTION IS SUCCESFUL
IF EXTRACTION IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IT WILL MOVE IMAGE BACK TO THE INPUT BUCKET
